                <h3 class="bonfire">Dark Sun Gwyndolin</h3>

                <p>Two knights of Lord Gwyn, they are tasked with guarding Gwynevere.</p>
                <h2 class="bonfire">Pinwheel</h2>
                <p>Necromancer who stole the Right of Kindling and fled to the Catacombs.<br> Pinwheel has three faces:
                    Father, Child, and Mother. Pinwheel was once a man who lost his son and wife. He attempted to bring
                    them back through necromancy, but ended up fusing their bodies with his. When Pinwheel clones
                    himself, it is actually his attempt at unfusing the three bodies. <br> Throughout the Pinwheel boss
                    fight, the masks can be heard whispering in the background of the music. What the Mother and Child
                    say is difficult to make out. The Mother chants something along the lines of, "We will never die,"
                    which refers to how the player will always obtain one of the Family Masks. It is believed that the
                    Child chants, "Help me." Although it is difficult to hear the Mother and Child, it is easy to hear
                    what the Father says. "I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry."</p>
