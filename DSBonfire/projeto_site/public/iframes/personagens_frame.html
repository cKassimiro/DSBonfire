        <h2><a target="blank"></a>Characters</h2>
        <h3>Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight</h3>
        <p>Bearer of the strongest Lord Soul, Gwyn's power manifested as great spears of sunlight, which take
            the form of lightning. He founded the kingdom of Anor Londo, lead an army of his silver knights
            against the dragons, and was father to Gwynevere, Gwyndolin, and his disowned firstborn son(thought
            to be Sen, the ancient God of War). Gwyn was the first to link the First Flame, becoming a Lord of
            Cinder, and now mindlessly guards it against outside threats and serves as a test of strength for
            those seeking to link it again. Gwyn's crown is said to have once had some special power, but its
            power has long since faded and now only exudes a slight warmth by the time the player acquires it.
            Gwyn and his clan are referred to as gods. Whether this is by Gwyn's own command or simply a title
            given to them by others for their strength is unknown, though they are still the primary religious
            figures in many human kingdoms. Gwyn is one of the four who happened upon the Lord Souls at the dawn
            of the Age Of Fire, along with Gravelord Nito, The Witch of Izalith and The Furtive Pygmy.</p>
        <h3>The Nameless Firstborn</h3>
        <p>The first son of Gwyn, he committed some serious offense and was stricken from the annals of history.
            His story is not expanded upon in Dark Souls 1.</p>
        <h3>Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight</h3>
        <p>The second daughter of Gwyn, and known as a goddess of fertility. The real Gwynevere married the
            flame god Flann and left Anor Londo long ago when the First Flame began to fade, but Gwyndolin
            created an illusion of her to maintain the image of power and stability in the kingdom. This
            illusion grants successful Undead the Lordvessel, and directs them to follow Kingseeker Frampt's
            advice and fill it with Lord Souls. Undead who ask can join the Princess Guard, knights of Gwynevere
            who grant aid to fellow Undead through the use of her miracles.</p>
        <h3>Gwyndolin, the Dark Sun</h3>
        <p>Youngest son of Gwyn, and the only god who stayed behind in Anor Londo. Gwyndolin has a deep
            adoration of the sun, and reveres his father, spending his time guarding Gwyn's tomb and
            orchestrating events alongside Kingseeker Frampt to delay the Age of Dark. Due to his strong
            connection to the moon and skill in its magic, he was raised as a daughter. Gwyndolin specializes in
            a form of sorcery that uses Faith instead of Intelligence, and he is capable of powerful illusions
            that are nearly indistinguishable from reality. In this way, he maintains the appearance of a
            thriving Anor Londo. In reality, the kingdom has long since been abandoned and experiences an
            endless night, and Gwyndolin and his Darkmoon Knights are the only ones who remain. Undead may join
            his company of knights if they wish, though any who dispell the illusion of Gwynevere or enter
            Gwyn's tomb are instead marked as irredeemable sinners and pursued by those same knights.</p>
        <h3>Kingseeker Frampt</h3>
        <p>One of the primordial serpents, Kingseeker Frampt finds Undead with the potential to be Lords, and
            directs them to link the First Flame, though he is not entirely forthwith and fails to mention that
            anyone who does will be trapped there, burning for an entire Age. Even so, linking the First Flame
            is necessary to prolong the Age of Fire and prevent an Age of Dark. Frampt will denounce the player
            and abandon them if they ever join Darkstalker Kaathe instead.</p>
        <h3>Dragonslayer Ornstein</h3>
        <p>Said to be the captain of Gwyn's four greatest knights. As with the other three, Ornstein was granted
            a fragment of Gwyn's soul for his service in the war against the dragons. He now guards the illusion
            of Gwynevere, serving as a test of strength to Undead who hope to link the First Flame. His
            accomplishments against the dragons are legendary, and his spear is said to have once split a
            boulder in two. He wields a cross spear infused with lightning, which uses leverage to penetrate
            dragon scales, let alone any normal human. Despite being a major figure in the story and even a boss
            in the game, not much is known about Ornstein beyond what could very well just be legends and
            hearsay.</p>
        <h3>Hawkeye Gough</h3>
        <p>A giant and a knight of Gwyn, Hawkeye Gough and his archers were known for using massive greatbows to
            shoot down flying dragons. Gough himself can fell a dragon with a single arrow the size of a tree.
            But the war is over, and Gough now spends his time carving archtree wood and imbuing it with spoken
            messages.</p>
        <h3>Lord's Blade Ciaran</h3>
        <p>One of Gwyn's assassins, and also one of the four knights. She is distinguished among the Lord's
            Blades, though it is never quite explained what exactly her accomplishments are. She is prejudiced
            against humans, but due to her respect for Artorias she tries to treat them fairly.</p>
        <h3>Artorias the Abysswalker</h3>
        <p>Legendary knight of Gwyn, known for his unbreakable will of steel and unmatched skill with
            greatswords. It is said that Artorias forged a pact with the beasts of the Abyss to fight against
            the Darkwraiths, but this is only a fabrication, as his true story was intentionally obscured and
            eventually forgotten. In reality, Artorias was defeated by the Abyss, and his efforts were carried
            on by a forgotten champion. This champion eventually defeated Manus, Father of the Abyss,
            successfully stalling the Abyss's growth for some time. Artorias was friends with Sif the Great Wolf
            and the cat Alvina, both of whom now defend his grave from those who hope to find the means to enter
            the Abyss.</p>
        <h3>Great Grey Wolf Sif</h3>
        <p>A towering wolf, and battle compatriot of Artorias. Legend holds that Artorias once traversed the
            Abyss to defeat the Darkwraiths, and his companion Sif now guards his grave to deter anyone who
            would try to enter the Abyss for their own means. If the player completed the Artorias of the Abyss
            DLC, Sif will recognize them, but this is still a mandatory fight and can't be avoided.</p>
        <h3>Alvina</h3>
        <p>Another ally of Knight Artorias, Alvina now leads a group of bandits to defend his grave. Any who
            approach the grave of Artorias in Darkroot Forest are attacked by her covenant, but players can join
            her covenant to also defend the grave from intruders and to allow free access to it.</p>
        <h3>Velka, Goddess of Sin</h3>
        <p>Velka is a black-haired witch and rogue goddess, though what this means is never explained. She keeps
            record of all sins committed by humans, and can absolve these sins for a price. She has some
            relation to crows, but what this means is not explained. Priests of Velka are called pardoners, and
            wander the lands taking confessions and absolving sins. Velka has two miracles in her name, Karmic
            Justice and Vow of Silence, and her hair can be fashioned into a talisman that draws strength from
            Intelligence instead of Faith. Miyazaki has said that the crow people in the Painted World of
            Ariamis are fervent followers of Velka, and became crow monsters in their devotion to her.</p>
        <h3>The Witch of Izalith</h3>
        <p>One of the four original Lord Soul bearers, her Lord Soul granted the power of fire. She is a witch
            and master of the now forgotten fire sorceries, and founded the city of Izalith with her daughters
            deep underground. When the First Flame began to fade, she attempted to create a second First Flame
            to replace it using her witchcraft and a special soul, but failed catastrophically and instead
            created the Flame of Chaos. The birth of Chaos marked the birth of demons, and its flame transformed
            the Witch of Izalith and all her daughters into demons barring Quelana, who escaped the destruction
            of her home. As the daughters of Izalith were the only practitioners of fire sorcery, it is now a
            forgotten art, but the creation of Chaos also created pyromancy as a byproduct. Gwyn waged war
            against the demons and eventually routed them, shackling the Bed of Chaos, their source of life, to
            contain them.</p>
        <h3>Quelana</h3>
        <p>One of the daughters of Izalith, and the only one who successfully escaped the destruction of her
            home. The end of Izalith marked the end of fire sorcery, but the creation of Chaos also marked the
            birth of pyromancy. Quelana adapted many old fire sorcery spells into pyromancy, then taught them to
            her pupil Salaman long ago, who then taught it to the outcasts who live in the Great Swamp. In
            teaching pyromancy, she hoped to teach people control over the flame to prevent another such
            disaster, while also preaching a message to fear the flame as it is inherently uncontrollable.
            Quelana is known to pre-date the Age of Fire, but by how much or even how at all is never explained.
        </p>
        <h3>Quelaag</h3>
        <p>One of the Daughters of Chaos, she fled Izalith with her sister, but was not able to escape before
            being transformed by the Flame of Chaos. She is now a demon, and has taken up residence near one of
            the two Bells of Awakening with her sister, the Fair Lady.</p>
        <h3>The Fair Lady</h3>
        <p>An unnamed Daugher of Chaos and a Firekeeper, she is pale and ill. Along with Quelaag, she fled the
            lost city of Izalith but still became a demon. The Fair Lady is afflicted by stillborn eggs, though
            unbeknownst to her each serves as a cradle for tiny Humanity sprites. She is tended to by her
            followers and members of her Chaos Servants covenant, who bring her the Humanity she needs. She is
            also a firekeeper, and mainand can assist an Undead by upgrading their Estus Flasks.
            She does not speak a language known by the player character, and can only be understood if they have
            the correct magic ring. Members of her covenant who offer her Humanity will be taught powerful
            pyromancies born from the Flame of Chaos, and can access the city of Izalith through a secret
            entrace. Her true name is unknown, and she isn't given a name even in the game's files.</p>
        <h3>Gravelord Nito</h3>
        <p>One of the four original Lord Soul bearers, Nito's soul grants power over death. Nito can inflict
            disease and decay, and animates skeletons to fight for him. Along with the other four original
            Lords, he played a major role in defeating the dragons and now holds dominion over an extended
            system of crypts and tombs where he watches over the dead. Nito leads a covenant, the Gravelord
            Servants, who use Eyes of Death to spread misfortune and curses, which produces more of the Eyes of
            Death Nito desires. Not much is known about him beyond this, though at one point a group of
            occultists tried to take a part of his Lord Soul in an attempt to slay the gods. More recently, the
            necromancer Pinwheel has been slowly draining Nito's power for his own use. Even despite all of
            this, Nito's Lord Soul remains strong enough to satiate the Lordvessel, and he is still a Lord in
            his own right.</p>
        <h3>Pinwheel</h3>
        <p>Necromancer of the Catacombs, he has been taking power from Nito's soul for his own ends. Pinwheel
            appears to have three heads and six arms, and concept art of him shows three separate bodies either
            stacked together or fused underneath his robe. Pinwheel himself is not especially powerful, and does
            not accomplish anything of note in the story. His three masks are each enchanted with special power,
            and will fortify the body of anyone wearing them.</p>
        <h3>Seath the Scaleless</h3>
        <p>Seath was born without the scales that make other dragons immortal. In his envy, he betrayed them and
            stole the primordial crystal, which granted him near complete invulnerability, if not an adequate
            imitation of immortality. After the war, he was given the title of Duke by Gwyn, a fragment of
            Gwyn's own soul, and a tower and archives to conduct his research in. Seath eventually codified a
            system of magic utilizing souls, and is known as the father of sorcery by the Dragon School of
            Vinheim which teaches it. Seath spent his time trying to find the secrets of immortality and produce
            scales for himself, but his research eventually drove him mad and his experiments became more and
            more deranged. By the time the game begins, he is sending his minions out to kidnap maidens and
            perform horrible atrocities on them, turning them into monsters. In his madness, he developed
            powerful sorceries based on a link between souls and crystals, the mere study of which is enough to
            drive other wizards equally insane. As with all dragons, his tail can be severed to find a special
            weapon: the Moonlight Greatsword, a non-physical blade that shoots, and is composed of, waves of
            moonlight.</p>
        <h3>Big Hat Logan</h3>
        <p>A famous sorcerer who once studied at the Vinheim Dragon School of sorcery, students of Seath's work.
            Logan is known for developing new and powerful sorceries, one of which is believed to be on par with
            Lord Gwyn's lightning. He eventually left the Dragon School, and traveled to Lordran when he became
            Undead over one hundred years ago, seeking Seath's legendary archives. Should he manage to reach it,
            Logan will study Seath's research and develop even more powerful crystal sorceries, but will
            eventually go mad when he recreates Seath's crystal breath as a spell.</p>
        <h3>The Furtive Pygmy</h3>
        <p>One of the orignal four Lords who waged war on the dragons, along with Gwyn, Nito, and the Witch of
            Izalith. Gwyn feared the Dark Soul the pygmy possessed, and all records of his or her existence and
            contributions to the war were stricken fron history. The pygmy is the ancestor of all Humanity, all
            of whom each bear a tiny piece of the Dark Soul.</p>
        <h3>The Four Kings</h3>
        <p>Rulers of New Londo, a city of Undead. They were granted fragments of Gwyn's Lord Soul in recognition
            of their skill as leaders, and peacefully ruled New Londo for a time. They eventually encountered
            Darkstalker Kaathe, who taught them the art of Lifedrain, and in joining him they and their knights
            became the Darkwraiths. The armor and weapons of their knights were twisted into a skeletal
            appearance, and the Four Kings themselves now reside in the Abyss and became things scarcely human.
            They and the Darkwraiths were eventually trapped within New Londo, which was flooded to contain
            them, though they are not yet dead.</p>
        <h3>Darkstalker Kaathe</h3>
        <p>One of the primordial serpents, Darkstalker Kaathe acts to end the Age of Fire and begin an Age of
            Dark. It is suspected that he is the one who tricked the people of Oolacile into reviving Manus, and
            in the game itself he argues that the player character should forsake the First Flame and become a
            Lord of Dark, ruling over an age of Humanity. His words are true, though much like Frampt he leaves
            out a lot of important details that might otherwise lead a person to think twice. Kaathe taught the
            art of Lifedrain to the Four Kings of New Londo, causing them and their knights to become corrupted
            by the Dark and giving rise to the Darkwraiths, Humanity-stealing Undead knights who are a threat to
            anything with a soul. The Darkwraiths now answer to Kaathe, and he commands them to go out and steal
            Humanity from their fellow Undead in the hopes that one among them will become powerful enough to
            qualify as a Dark Lord. Should the player side with Kaathe, Frampt will denounce them and leave, but
            should the player side with Frampt, Kaathe will never show himself in the first place.</p>
        <h3>Manus, Father of the Abyss</h3>
        <p>A primeval human, Manus was once a man but becomes a twisted abomination after being resurrected. His
            Humanity goes wild, and similarly mutates any other human it comesin contact with. He is a dark
            sorcerer of immense power, and wields the strength of the Abyss to bring the kingdom of Oolacile to
            its knees in short order, capturing the Princess Dusk. The Abyss spreads rapidly under his guidance,
            and while its spread is halted with his death, Gough notes that this is only a temporary measure.
            The knight Artorias attempts to stop him, but is defeated. Manus himself is warped beyond the
            ability to reason by his revival, and desperately seeks his precious pendant, which he never finds.
            He demonstrates the ability to reach beyond time and space, snatching at least two people from the
            future and dragging them back into the past.</p>
        <h3>Stone Dragon of Ash Lake</h3>
        <p>A descendant of the ancient dragons, and leader of a covenant of Undead who seek to become dragons
            themselves. The player can join a covenant with the Stone Dragon to receive items that partially
            transform them into a dragon. The Dragon Greatsword, a weapon imbued with the Stone Dragon's power,
            is found by cutting its tail. The dragon doesn't seem to mind, and doesn't become hostile to the
            player if they cut its tail.</p>
        <h3>Black Dragon Kalameet</h3>
        <p>An ancient and powerful dragon, and survivor of the war against dragons. Kalameet himself was above
            and beyond the other dragons in terms of strength, and Gwyn and the other Lords dared not to provoke
            his ire. Those who challenge Kalameet can expect a long and difficult fight, all for a cursed ring
            that makes its wearer take double damage from enemy attacks. As with all other dragons, Kalameet's
            tail can be severed to find the Obsidian Greatsword, a weapon imbued with his might.</p>
        <h3>Solaire of Astora</h3>
        <p>Knight Solaire is a follower of the Warriors of Sunlight covenant, and introduces the player to the
            game's co-op mechanics. Solaire worships the god Gwyn, and desires to find a sun of his own.
            Contrary to some theories, he is an ordinary human and his excessive power is only a result of
            training and dedication to his goal, as explained in the descriptions for his equipment. Solaire's
            questline has two ends: in one, he falls into despair and finds the Sunlight Maggot, a shining and
            parasitic demon that drives him insane. But if the player kills the Sunlight Maggot before he can
            find it, Solaire will instead recover from his despair and later offers his assistance against Gwyn,
            Lord of Cinder.</p>
        <h3>Andre of Astora</h3>
        <p>A blacksmith from Astora, trained in smithing weapons both mundane and divine. He can reinforce
            weapons to their maximum strength, or infuse them with divine power to gain bonus damage from Faith.
            Peculiarly, he has a unique model and is the only character whose mouth moves when speaking. The
            statues that hold divine embers share his model.</p>
        <h3>Siegmeyer of Catarina</h3>
        <p>A knight of Catarina, Siegmeyer came to Lordran when he became Undead. Siegmeyer is searching for
            adventure, and the player can find him in a variety of predicaments throughout the game. His
            questline is linked with his daughter Sieglinde, and both must be completed together.</p>
        <h3>Sieglinde of Catarina</h3>
        <p>Daughter of Siegmeyer, she is searching for her father to give him her mother's last words. If their
            questline is completed, she eventually finds him, but he has gone hollow. She resolves to kill him
            again and again until he can finally rest permanently.</p>
        <h3>Laurentius of the Great Swamp</h3>
        <p>A pyromancer from the Great Swamp, Laurentius was overjoyed when he became Undead, and journeyed to
            Lordran in the hopes that he might someday find the legendary witch Quelana, mother of pyromancy. He
            teaches the player basic pyromancy spells, and will give them a part of his own pyromancy flame if
            they don't already have one. If the player ever finds Quelana, they can tell him about her. He will
            leave to find her, but wanders lost through Blighttown and eventually goes hollow.</p>
        <h3>Eingyi</h3>
        <p>A servant of the Fair Lady, he tends to her and guards her against intruders. He bears parasitic eggs
            as a sign of devotion and sympathy for the Fair Lady's suffering. He was once a pyromancer from the
            Great Swamp, but was driven out for his perversions of the art of fire, which turned flame into
            clouds of poison and inflicted prolonged suffering upon others. Eingyi is skilled with pyromancy,
            and will share his knowledge with those who show as much devotion to the Fair Lady as he does.</p>
        <h3>Griggs of Vinheim</h3>
        <p>An admirer of Big Hat Logan, who hopes to study sorcery with him. Grigg's attire and equipment
            suggests he may in fact be one of Vinheim's spies, but whether he's following Logan under their
            orders or simply went his own way when he became Undead is not known.</p>
        <h3>Blacksmith Rickert of Vinheim</h3>
        <p>Another former student of Vinheim, Rickert is found locked in a cell near the upper edge of New
            Londo. Surprisingly, Rickert is in there willingly and stays because it's safe from the hollows. He
            is a talented mage-smith, and can imbue the player's weapons with magic, allowing them to gain bonus
            damage from Intelligence.</p>
        <h3>Ingward, the Sealer</h3>
        <p>One of three healers who devised a plan to contain the Darkwraiths by flooding New Londo, knowing
            that this would also cause the deaths of countless innocents. The three swore to remain and watch
            over the city, and wear distinctive masks as a symbol of their oath, but by the time the game starts
            Ingward is the only one who remains. Ingward himself knows sorcery that can cure curses, a power
            said to be on par with divine acts. The corpse and spell of the second sealer can be found in
            Blighttown, and their poison-curing sorcery may suggest that they were trying to relieve the
            suffering there. The final sealer is found with Lautrec in Anor Londo, though they no longer wear
            their mask which suggests they may have forsaken their oath.</p>
        <h3>Princess Dusk of Oolacile</h3>
        <p>The princess of the human kingdom of Oolacile, Dusk is trapped in one of Seath's crystal golems when
            the player finds her. She owes the player character a debt of gratitude, and offers to teach them
            the sorceries of her kingdom before she fades back to her natural time. The player can then use her
            sign to summon her and learn the long forgotten light-based spells of Oolacile. As the events of the
            game progress, she is eventually captured by the resurrected Manus, who then pulls the player
            character into the past when they try to investigate.</p>
        <h3>Patches the Hyena</h3>
        <p>Patches is a wandering merchant, travelling the world and selling his wares. He is known for tricking
            people and luring them into death traps, then looting their corpses for trinkets to sell. If the
            player forgives him for this, he will eventually offer to sell his wares to them as well. Patches
            holds a great disdain for clerics, and will never make peace if the player is one.</p>
        <h3>Crossbreed Priscilla</h3>
        <p>A half-dragon hybrid. Priscilla was a forlorn outcast, feared by the gods for her power of lifehunt,
            and eventually found her way to the Painted World of Ariamis. Her weapons are imbued with the power
            of lifehunt, which causes heavy bleeding in living things. She is not initially hostile, and simply
            asks the player to return to their own world when first encountered. As with other dragons, her tail
            can be cut to find a special weapon.</p>
        <h3>The Gaping Dragon</h3>
        <p>A descendant of the ancient dragons, the Gaping Dragon was consumed by gluttony and slowly
            transformed into a giant mouth. It attacks the player relentlessly in its hunger, and must be killed
            because it ate the key to Blighttown. Cutting off its tail will give the Dragon King Greataxe, a
            weapon imbued with the Gaping Dragon's strength.</p>
        <h3>Marvelous Chester</h3>
        <p>A man of mystery snatched from the future by Manu and Stranded in the Past in Oolacile. He can serve
            as a merchant.</p>
        <h3>Elizabeth</h3>
        <p>A Giant Mushroom, who is guardian to the sanctuary in Oolacile and Godmother to Princess Dusk. She is
            the source of the Legend of the Abysswalker.</p>
