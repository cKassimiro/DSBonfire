                <h2><a class="animacao" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
                <p style="text-align: center;">"In the Age of Ancients, the world was unformed, shrouded by fog. A
                    land of gray crags, Archtrees and Everlasting Dragons.<br>But then there was fire, and
                    with fire came disparity. Heat and cold, life and death, and of course, light and
                    dark.<br>Then from the dark, they came, and found the Souls of Lords within the
                    flame.<br>Nito, the first of the dead,<br>the Witch of Izalith, and her
                    Daughters of Chaos,<br>Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight, and his faithful
                    knights,<br>and the furtive pygmy, so easily forgotten.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">"With the Strength of Lords, they challenged the
                    Dragons.<br>Gwyn's mighty bolts peeled apart their stone scales.<br>The
                    Witches weaved great firestorms.<br>Nito unleashed a miasma of death and
                    disease.<br>And Seath the Scaleless betrayed his own, and the Dragons were no
                    more.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">"Thus began the Age of Fire. But soon, the flames will fade, and only
                    Dark will remain.<br>Even now, there are only embers, and man sees not light, but only
                    endless nights.<br>And amongst the living are seen, carriers of the accursed
                    Darksign."</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">"Yes, indeed. The Darksign brands the Undead.<br>And in this
                    land, the Undead are corralled and led to the north,<br>where they are locked away, to
                    await the end of the world.<br>... This is your fate."</p>
                <p style="text-align: right;">- Dark Souls, opening cinematic</p>
                <p>The world of Dark Souls is a world of cycles. Kingdoms rise and fall, ages come and go, and even time
                    can end and restart as the flame fades and is renewed. These cycles are linked to the First Flame, a
                    mysterious manifestation of life that divides and defines separate states such as heat and cold, or
                    life and death. As the First Flame fades, these differences also begin to fade, such as life and
                    death having little distinction, and humans becoming Undead. The onset of an Age of Dark, the time
                    when the First Flame has fully died, is marked by endless nights, rampant undeath, time, space, and
                    reality breaking down, lands collapsing and converging on one another, people mutating into
                    monsters, darkness covering the world, and the Gods losing their power. To avoid this and prolong
                    the Age of Fire, the bearer of a powerful soul must "link" themselves to the First Flame, becoming
                    the fuel for another age. If this is not done, the First Flame will eventually die, and an Age of
                    Dark will begin.</p>
                <p>The powerful Lord Souls were taken from the First Flame, used to defeat the dragons, and then to
                    establish kingdoms. Souls are inextricably (and inexplicably) linked to fire. Souls are life, and
                    life is fire; it stands to reason that souls are fire, as well. Without the First Flame and without
                    souls, there is no life. The bearer of a strong soul, called a Lord, who links themselves to the
                    First Flame, is thus rekindling the flames with their own soul, returning life to it. In the end,
                    one could expect that all souls will have been returned to the First Flame, and the Age of Fire will
                    have effectively ended anyways.</p>
                <p>It is inevitable that people try to find a way around this, another way to continue the Age of Fire
                    without making sacrifices, but in every case they fail. In the first Age of Fire, the Witch of
                    Izalith attempted to create a duplicate of the First Flame using her witchcraft and a special soul,
                    but failed catastrophically. Instead of making another First Flame, she had created a twisted Flame
                    of Chaos that produced distortions of life, turning herself and all her daughters into demons. These
                    demons were malevolent, and wandered the land. Gwyn gathered up his armies and fought the demons of
                    Chaos, eventually driving them back and shackling the Bed of Chaos to bind them. Knowing that the
                    Age of Fire was nearing its end, under the guidance of the primordial serpent Kingseeker Frampt,
                    Gwyn offered himself to the First Flame to stave off the Dark. As the flames surged with new life,
                    the knights who followed him in were burnt by the flames and now wander the world as the Black
                    Knights, hollow shells of armor who attack indiscriminately.</p>
                <p>Before he left to link the First Flame, Gwyn gave fragments of his soul to his followers and allies.
                    Ornstein, Gough, Ciaran, and Artorias, his four strongest knights who fought against the dragons,
                    Seath the Paledrake, who betrayed the dragons and played a crucial role in the war, and was also
                    granted the title of Duke and permission to build a grand archive to conduct his research, and the
                    Four Kings of New Londo, who ruled a city of Undead. In time, another primordial serpent convinced
                    the people of the human kingdom of Oolacile to delve into the darkness of the Abyss to unearth the
                    grave of an ancient human. Whether through their actions or some other means, the primordial human -
                    Manus - was resurrected and driven to madness, and his wild Humanity caused the people of Oolacile
                    to mutate into abominations. Manus, Father of the Abyss, began to rapidly spread Dark and accelerate
                    the growth of the Abyss, and would've started an early Age of Dark had he not been defeated. Even
                    so, the kingdom of Oolacile was lost to the Abyss, and eventually forgotten in the modern day.
                    Nothing remains in the present day to mark the passing of this land save for Dusk, the princess of
                    Oolacile.</p>
                <p>Gwyn's youngest son Gwyndolin, together with Kingseeker Frampt, sheperds the humans by Gwyn's
                    command. Together they built giant asylums to house the countless undead, hoping against hope that
                    one of them would be chosen to defeat the Asylum demon, and fulfill their destiny. The Undead are
                    sent on a quest to ring the Bells of Awakening, collect the Lordvessel, slay the bearers of Gwynn's
                    soul, then offer those souls to the Lordvessel to open the path to the Kiln of the First Flame. In
                    doing so, the unnatural Undead are given true death and the living can enjoy another age of fire for
                    a thousand years, while the Undead linked to the First Flame will continue to burn, alive and aware,
                    until someone else comes to take their place. And thus, the cycle continues.</p>
                <h2><a class="animacao" target="blank" id="areas"></a>Locations</h2>
                <h3>Lordran</h3>
                <p>Known as the land of the ancient Lords, where their kingdoms converge. This is where the game takes
                    place, and it is a dangerous area indeed. Containing a great variety of environments and filled with
                    many dangerous creatures, any Undead's resolve will be tested to the fullest here. The Undead travel
                    great distances to reach this land, where the First Flame waits to be linked.</p>
                <h3>Anor Londo</h3>
                <p>Known as the city of the gods, and founded by Lord Gwyn. It sits at the top of a mountain, and both
                    the cliff face and its own walls separate it from the outside world. Long ago, invitations were
                    given to great champions among humans, decided through victories in an arena, but this practice has
                    not been kept up for some time. Sen's Fortress sits below it, an enormous deathtrap serving as both
                    gateway and obstacle to Anor Londo, and those who could overcome it were permitted access, but the
                    pathway at the end has since been sealed. Now, any Undead seeking to enter the city are carried in
                    by bat-winged demons if they can overcome the fortress. The truth of Anor Londo is hidden behind an
                    intricate illusion; when the First Flame began to fade, all of the gods abandoned Anor Londo save
                    for Gwyndolin, Gwyn's youngest son. He now uses his magic to make it look like the city still stands
                    strong, but in reality only he and his knights remain, and he is the only true authority left.</p>
                <h3>Lost Izalith</h3>
                <p>Legendary city of the Witch of Izalith, one of the four original Lords. She and her daughters founded
                    this city deep underground. The Witch and her daughters were originally practitioners of a form of
                    fire sorcery, but this art was lost when the Flame of Chaos destroyed the city. When the First Flame
                    began to fade, the Witch of Izalith tried to reproduce it using her magic and a special soul.
                    However, she failed, and the result was the Flame of Chaos: a twisted flame that produced distorted
                    life instead, known as the demons. Gwyn and his knights waged a war against these demons and
                    eventually defeated them, sealing the Bed of Chaos, their source of life, with magic. Some demons
                    now appear in roles that suggest they may work for the gods, either willingly or as captured
                    servants. The creation of the Flame of Chaos also created pyromancy as a byproduct, and Quelana, the
                    only Daughter of Izalith to escape the destruction, was able to develop an entire system of magic to
                    imitate the ancient fire spells. She took only one student, Salaman from the Great Swamp. In
                    teaching Salaman, she hoped that mankind could learn to harness and control the flames, to prevent
                    the same catastrophy that destroyed her own home. Salaman then returned to the Great Swamp to spread
                    the art of pyromancy.</p>
                <h3>The Catacombs</h3>
                <p>An extensive network of tombs and crypts, overseen by Gravelord Nito. All things that die are laid to
                    rest here, and Nito's power of necromancy ensures that they are not disturbed. The area is not
                    completely peaceful, however, and at one point a group of occultists attempted to steal Nito's power
                    and use it to kill the gods. They presumably failed, but weapons and artefacts of their perverse
                    rituals can still be found. Now the necromancer Pinwheel resides in the catacombs, where he slowly
                    siphons away Nito's power for his own ends.</p>
                <h3>New Londo</h3>
                <p>A large city of Undead, this place was once prosperous and known for the foresight of its leaders.
                    All undead were welcomed here, and it soon became a safe haven for undead that were banished from
                    their homelands. New Londo was a city teeming with culture and life. Recognizing this, Lord Gwyn
                    bestowed on the four leaders a fragment of his soul and the rank of king before he left to link the
                    First Flame. Later, the Four Kings encountered Darkstalker Kaathe in the Abyss, who offered to teach
                    them the art of lifedrain. In doing so, the Four Kings and their order of knights were corrupted by
                    the dark, becoming the Darkwraiths of Kaathe. The threat they posed to the outside world was so
                    great that the whole city was flooded to contain them, killing everyone inside. The dead still
                    wander as ghosts through the ruins, and the Darkwraiths themselves survived the flooding even though
                    they are still trapped.</p>
                <h3>Oolacile</h3>
                <p>An ancient and long forgotten human kingdom that was once in Lordran. It was a peaceful land of
                    scholars, who practiced a now lost form of light-based sorcery. Before its fall, a path to the Abyss
                    was unearthed, and they encountered a primordial serpent who convinced them to delve into the depths
                    of the Abyss to unearth the grave of a primordial human. When revived, this human, named Manus, went
                    mad, and his humanity went wild. This caused him to mutate into a huge abomination, and contact with
                    his humanity caused the people of Oolacile to also mutate into abominations. Manus was a powerful
                    sorcerer and master of the Dark, and with his magic he guided the Abyss to grow, swiftly overtaking
                    the kingdom of Oolacile. Knight Artorias was sent in to defeat Manus and halt the Abyss, but he
                    failed and was corrupted by the Dark instead. The Chosen Undead travels back in time to lay Artorias
                    to rest and defeat Manus in his stead. As the player is not naturally from that time, their actions
                    are instead attributed to Artorias, to be known as the Abysswalker, a legendary knight who traversed
                    the Abyss to defeat the Darkwraiths.</p>
                <h3>Astora</h3>
                <p>A human kingdom outside Lordran, it is a land known for its traditional knights, clergy, and
                    nobility. The Way of White originates from here, and the knight and cleric classes available to the
                    player are apparently travelers from this land and start with the Way of White covenant. The Way of
                    White itself is very proactive about removing Undead, and sponsors great hunts to round them up and
                    forcibly transport them to an asylum on the edge of Lordran. Clerics and knights within the Way of
                    White who become Undead are sent to Lordran on a pilgrimage, where they are told to search the
                    Catacombs and learn the Rite of Kindling. At some point in the past, a terrible beast known as the
                    Evil Eye attacked the kingdom of Astora, causing great damage. It was defeated, and its spirit is
                    rumored to be trapped in a magic ring.</p>
                <h3>Catarina</h3>
                <p>Another kingdom outside Lordran that is known for its festivites and drinks, and also for the
                    peculiar onion-like armor of its knights. Their armor was designed to deflect blows and is actually
                    highly effective, and the knights take great pride in it, but the appearance is still mocked by
                    outsiders.</p>
                <h3>The Great Swamp</h3>
                <p>A distant and inhospitable land outside Lordran, unwanted by all save for the people who live there.
                    Not a formal kingdom per se, it is populated by outcasts and exiles from other lands. They share a
                    common interest in the teachings of pyromancy, and appear to practice some form of shamanism as
                    well. As they are not a proper kingdom, they have no order of knights, but pyromancy is an easy
                    craft to use and is still very powerful. Travelers from the Great Swamp are often equipped with
                    wrapped clothing that protects them from the dangers of their homeland, and versatile hand axes that
                    serve as both tools and weapons. It is not specified whether Undead are welcome there, but Undead
                    from there are often ecstatic for the chance to travel to Lordran and hopefully visit the ancient
                    city of Izalith.</p>
                <h3>Vinheim</h3>
                <p>A land known for the Dragon School, a place of study for the system of sorcery formalized by Seath
                    the Scaleless. The School employs its own spies and assassins trained in sound-manipulating magic,
                    and through this maintain control of the city and its politics. The sorcerer starting class
                    available to the player originates from Vinheim.</p>
                <h3>Carim</h3>
                <p>This kingdom is most known for its shady aristocrats and knights, and its gods. If anything, it is
                    the polar opposite of Astora. Pardoners of Velka, the rogue goddess, are known to come from here,
                    and it is home to the infamous Arstor of Carim. It is a place known for distinctive weaponry: Carim
                    knights use lightweight parrying daggers in place of shields and their Shotels cut a sinister
                    profile, and its archers are trained in a unique crossbow specialized for sniping. A very particular
                    kind of magic ring originates from here, exceptional at resisting status effects but rumored to be
                    created through dreadful means. The Purging Stone items are also from Carim, and the fact that they
                    contain the remains of humans raises serious questions about the nature of their production.</p>
                <h3>Undead Asylum</h3>
                <p>An asylum for the undead on the edge of Lordran. Undead were corralled here, and in many such places
                    by order of Gwyndolin, the youngest son of Gwynn, Lord of Sunlight. The Undead are kept here in
                    hopes that one day one of them would be chosen to be able to defeat the gatekeeper, the fearsome
                    Asylum demon and go on to link the first flame. It is still unclear whether the Undead is chosen

                                    optical illusions, and gentle survival spells in general. Princess Dusk of Oolacile,
                                    the last surviving of her kind, was taken from her home and banished to a plane of
                                    distortion. She has since remained trapped in a crystal golem. Her people once
                                    believed in, and were guided by the Great Flames. Some people claim that Darkroot
                                    Forest was Oolacile before it was destroyed, explaining Dusk's location and the
                                    ruins in the forest. This theory is further supported by the location of the
                                    mushroom people in both Darkroot Garden and Oolacile, and the fact that the
                                    geography of the two locations are remarkably similar. The stone bridge leading from
                                    the Sif boss fight and the surrounding wooded areas are almost identical to the
                                    Oolacile Sanctuary and the early stages of the Royal Wood. This may also explain why
                                    Sif guards the grave of Artorius at this location, since Artorius succumbed to the
                                    abyss whilst in Oolacile.</td>

                    the town that leads to the domain of a mutated entity of Chaos who guards a bell tower. It then
                    leads further into Lordran's fiery underworld. One of the three sorcerers who sealed New Londo
                    ventured here, bringing about her a spell she hoped to use to quell the disease found in this
                    wretched place. Unfortunately, she died instead, leaving behind only her robes and the spell. You
                    will hate this place.</p>

                    The dead now roam the ruins as ghosts, with more sinister enemies lurking beneath the frigid depths.

                <h3>The Duke's Archives</h3>
                <p>The Forbidden regal archives, a storehouse of knowledge. Constructed by Seath the Scaleless after his
                    betrayal of the dragons for Lord Gwyn. This impressive bastion of information served as the center
                    for Seath's quest for obtaining the one aspect of the dragons he never obtained: immortality.
                    Through intense experimentation and dangerous obsession, Seath eventually created a crystal-like
                    device capable of sustaining everlasting life, but not without costing Seath his sanity and the
                    Archive's their pristine condition as both succumbed to the influence of the crystal. The knowledge
                    within is dangerous to mortals and gods alike, turning them insane with every turn of the page.</p>

                    caves are perilous and are plagued with surprisingly formidable Crystal Golems, Moonlight
                    Butterflies (which unlike their boss counterpart, make no attempt to land; this aspect makes them
                    much more difficult for melee-based builds), and invisible pathways. The source of Seath's power is
                    located within these caves--thus, his vulnerability.</p>

                <p>The Four Kings were the beings who ruled New Londo, before they had fallen to the Dark. Recognized
                    for their Foresight, The Lord of Sunlight granted them a piece of his Soul, the Lord Soul, to the
                    four kings. However, after the departure of Gwyn, the Kings had fell to the Dark, tempted by the
                    Primordial Serpent, <a class="animacao" target="blank"

                    the Four Kings resided into the Abyss as their permanent domain.</p>

                <h3>Seath the Scaleless</h3>
                <p>Seath the Scaleless was a dragon who betrayed his own kind and allied with Lord Gwyn, most likely
                    because of his absence of scales/immortality. Frampt refers to him as Gwyn's former confidant. After
                    the victory over the Everlasting Dragons, he was awarded a Dukedom and a small piece of a Lord Soul
                    and was embraced by the royalty. He began pouring research into the Scales of Immortality,
                    eventually going insane. He had servants called "snatchers" who would steal away maidens for
                    nefarious reasons (most likely his research into crystals). The blue octopus creatures are mistakes
                    resulting from this research. Aside from insanity, having no scales, being an albino, and having no
                    legs he apparently has very bad eyesight, this being the reason his Channelers have six eyes on
                    their mask. What he does have, though, is a form of immortality through the Primordial Crystal, a
                    dragon artifact he pillaged when he defected. He is also speculated to be the father of the
                    Crossbreed Priscilla.</p>
                <p>The argument has been presented that Seath and his machinations were responsible for the downfall of
                    the kingdom of Oolacile. If understood that the Darkroot Gardens are the lost remains to the
                    kingdom, it becomes more clear as to what may have happened. The evidence that many of Seath's
                    creations are found outside of his archives and caves only in the Gardens gives support to this
                    theory. In addition the Crystal Golems appearing in number within the Basin, the Golden Crystal
                    Golem (a creation used to ensnare people, trapping them for lifetimes) holds Dusk of Oolacile, the
                    princess of her former kingdom. In addition, a lone Moonlight Butterfly roams the ruins, another
                    indication that the land is not unfamiliar to Seath.</p>

                <p>Gravelord Nito, the First of the Dead, was one of the original four lords that fought against the
                    dragons. While Lord Gwyn pierced the dragons with lightning bolts and the witches weaved great
                    firestorms that scorched the land, Nito unleashed a miasma of disease and toxin that would kill all
                    that got caught in it. At some point after the battle there once was a plot to destroy the gods and
                    the followers of an occult once attempted to steal the power of Nito to do so. Nito now resides
                    within the deepest part of The Catacombs, The Tomb of the Giants, and is the leader of the Covenant,

                <p>One of the original Lords who aided Gwyn in the war against the Dragons. The Witch of Izalith
                    attempted to duplicate the First Flame from a soul, but instead created a distorted being of Chaos
                    and Fire. Its power formed a bed of life which would become the source of all demons. The Flame of
                    Chaos also engulfed the Witch and her daughters and molded them into deformed creatures, with only
                    Quelana escaping. The Witch of Izalith had been transformed into a Firekeeper of the Chaos Flame,
                    although is just an unmoving Grub being protected by the Flame, rather than the Witch protecting the
                    Flame Itself. She resides under the roots of the Chaos Flame.</p>

                <h3>The Furtive Pygmy</h3>
                <p>The progenitor of the Player Character, the Pygmy discovered the unique Dark Soul amongst the other
                    lords before fading into obscurity. Passing the soul down through his lineage, the Pygmy hoped that
                    his descendants would extinguish the Age of Fire and usher the Age of Darkness, installing the
                    humans as the new rulers of the world over the old Gods.</p>
                <p>Speculation has given rise to the theory that the Dark Soul found by the pygmy during the Age of
                    Ancients was the source of all humanity. Just as Lord Gwyn demonstrated that the greatest souls can
                    be broken into shards so to was the Dark Soul. Within the power of this soul was the basis for all
                    humanity and life through humans. Darkstalker Kaathe would seemingly support this theory as his
                    insistence on collecting humanities found in others could be construed as an attempt to recreate as
                    much of the Dark Soul as possible for the eventual rise of the Dark Lord.</p>
                <p>Another theory says that Furitive Pygmy is <a class="animacao" target="blank"
                        href="https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Manus%2C+Father+of+the+Abyss">Manus</a>. Manus is
                    referred to as "primeval man" and "father of the abyss", while the Furitive Pygmy is both master of
                    the Dark Soul and one of the primeval men</p>

                <h3>Gwyn</h3>
                <p>Lord of Sunlight. He challenged the dragons, together with the other Lords. After he sacrificed

                    Knights who haunt Lordran. There were also four higher ranking knights, Ornstein, Ciaran, Artorias
                    and Gough. He once led the Silver Knights as well, when he was once the Lord of Sunlight, however
