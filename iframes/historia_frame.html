                The world of Dark Souls is a world of cycles. Kingdoms rise and fall, ages come and go, and even
                time can end and restart as the flame fades and is renewed. These cycles are linked to the First
                Flame, a mysterious manifestation of life that divides and defines separate states such as heat
                and
                cold, or life and death. As the First Flame fades, these differences also begin to fade, such as
                life and death having little distinction, and humans becoming Undead. The onset of an Age of
                Dark,
                the time when the First Flame has fully died, is marked by endless nights, rampant undeath,
                time,
                space, and reality breaking down, lands collapsing and converging on one another, people
                mutating
                into monsters, darkness covering the world, and the Gods losing their power. To avoid this and
                prolong the Age of Fire, the bearer of a powerful soul must "link" themselves to the First
                Flame,
                becoming the fuel for another age. If this is not done, the First Flame will eventually die, and
                an
                Age of Dark will begin.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                It is inevitable that people try to find a way around this, another way to continue the Age of
                Fire
                without making sacrifices, but in every case they fail. In the first Age of Fire, the Witch of
                Izalith attempted to create a duplicate of the First Flame using her witchcraft and a special
                soul,
                but failed catastrophically. Instead of making another First Flame, she had created a twisted
                Flame
                of Chaos that produced distortions of life, turning herself and all her daughters into demons.
                These
                demons were malevolent, and wandered the land. Gwyn gathered up his armies and fought the demons
                of
                Chaos, eventually driving them back and shackling the Bed of Chaos to bind them. Knowing that
                the
                Age of Fire was nearing its end, under the guidance of the primordial serpent Kingseeker Frampt,
                Gwyn offered himself to the First Flame to stave off the Dark. As the flames surged with new
                life,
                the knights who followed him in were burnt by the flames and now wander the world as the Black
                Knights, hollow shells of armor who attack indiscriminately.

                <br>
                <br>
                Before he left to link the First Flame, Gwyn gave fragments of his soul to his followers and
                allies.
                Ornstein, Gough, Ciaran, and Artorias, his four strongest knights who fought against the
                dragons,
                Seath the Paledrake, who betrayed the dragons and played a crucial role in the war, and was also
                granted the title of Duke and permission to build a grand archive to conduct his research, and
                the
                Four Kings of New Londo, who ruled a city of Undead. In time, another primordial serpent
                convinced
                the people of the human kingdom of Oolacile to delve into the darkness of the Abyss to unearth
                the
                grave of an ancient human. Whether through their actions or some other means, the primordial
                human -
                Manus - was resurrected and driven to madness, and his wild Humanity caused the people of
                Oolacile
                to mutate into abominations. Manus, Father of the Abyss, began to rapidly spread Dark and
                accelerate
                the growth of the Abyss, and would've started an early Age of Dark had he not been defeated.
                Even
                so, the kingdom of Oolacile was lost to the Abyss, and eventually forgotten in the modern day.
                Nothing remains in the present day to mark the passing of this land save for Dusk, the princess
                of
                Oolacile.

                <br>
                Gwyn's youngest son Gwyndolin, together with Kingseeker Frampt, sheperds the humans by Gwyn's
                command. Together they built giant asylums to house the countless undead, hoping against hope
                that
                one of them would be chosen to defeat the Asylum demon, and fulfill their destiny. The Undead
                are
                sent on a quest to ring the Bells of Awakening, collect the Lordvessel, slay the bearers of
                Gwynn's
                soul, then offer those souls to the Lordvessel to open the path to the Kiln of the First Flame.
                In
                doing so, the unnatural Undead are given true death and the living can enjoy another age of fire
                for
                a thousand years, while the Undead linked to the First Flame will continue to burn, alive and
                aware,
                until someone else comes to take their place. And thus, the cycle continues.
